                 My MBTI personality is ESTP-A. This type is described as direct, bold, sociable, energetic, practical, perceptive, and original, which is true to some extent. In addition, I have taken another test, which is called “The Belbin Team Role Test”. My results are: Shaper and Team Worker. According to Belbin [10], as a Shaper, I would help my team with my drives and courage to overcome obstacles, thus ensuring the team keeps everything on track. As a Team Worker, I could be very perceptive and diplomatic, which would be a great contribution in friction aversion. On the other hand, I could become very aggressive in order to get the work done, and might be hesitant to speak out my opinion if it is not popular.<br>Therefore, I would like to have teammates with excellent communication skills, people who are not afraid to ask questions, and comprehend constructive criticism. I would also need other Team Workers, the types who enjoy cooperating, and not a lone-wolf.

                <p>“Reco” is an all-in-one recommendation application to help people spend less time browsing, more time doing. With Reco, people could easily choose what movies to watch, books to read, restaurants to eat at, or songs to listen to. The main feature of the mobile application behaves similarly to Tinder, a type of social network with an unparalleled card-swiping experience to match favourite products between people.</p>

                <p>In this era of convenience thanks to the evolution of technology, all forms of entertainment are made ready for us to pick one and let ourselves relax. Everything is so simple and convenient, and yet when it comes to choosing a place to eat, a movie to watch, or a book to read together, I and my peers always think that this process is painful and such a waste of time. Most of the time, we gave up and ended up cancelling the whole plan. It is a fact that there are around 800+ movies released every year [1], 40,000+ songs released every day [2]. Shockingly, there are already 440,000 street food stalls/kiosks; nearly 8,000 fast-food outlets; 85,000 full-service restaurants; 24,000 cafeterias/bars in Vietnam in 2015 [3]. Research shows that young adults spend about 10 minutes choosing what to watch [4]. Moreover, 43% give up if they cannot find something to watch, 49% say the sheer amount of content available makes it hard to choose what to watch [5]. I believe that young adults and teens spend too much time searching or choosing between which movies to watch, books to read, or restaurants to eat at. Everyone wants to read, watch, or eat something they love. But how can one know or pick the best outcome through so many options?</p>

                <h4>Explaination:</h4>
                <p>First of all, when signing up for an account on Reco, the users would be guided through an onboarding process where they would choose their favourite genres for each category, including movies, books, restaurants, and songs. Then, when logged in, the users would be greeted with a “Match” screen, where there is a stack of random cards of movies, books, songs, and restaurants based on their chosen genres from the onboarding process. They can swipe right when it shows their favourite titles, and swipe left if they do not like what they are seeing. If it is a match, there will be a notification, and the two people could set up a night out together, whether it be virtually or in-person, it is up to them to decide. Moreover, if the users have friends on Reco, the application would also show who recently liked that title on the card to streamline the experience. The “Lists” screen, as mentioned, would show recommendations. These lists depend on what the users liked, bookmarked, rated, and matched. Their behaviour will be recorded and transferred to a Machine Learning model, which will then streamline the algorithms of our recommender system, and provide the users with the titles that they will most likely watch. The cards to show on the “Match” screen are also based on the exact same technology. Thus, saving their time to choose what to do.</p>

                <p>As a mobile application, we would want to cover as many mobile users as possible. Therefore, a cross-platform front-end framework such as React Native or Flutter would be a wise choice. As for the back-end, Reco would fetch data back and forth through the REST API, interacting with a modern relational database such as SQLAlchemy or PostgreSQL. Tensorflow would be utilized to build the machine learning model. Lastly, we would need to acquire an enormous database of all movies, books, restaurants, and songs.</p>

                <p>The team would need to be prepared on the knowledge of mobile application development, and one cross-platform mobile framework. Besides, the application would need a rather complex database, so we must be able to design a database, with concrete knowledge about database systems. Finally, the team would need extensive knowledge on machine learning, with solid research skills in order to build a decent recommender system. </p>

                <p>If the product is a success, on the users side, peers would connect with each other much easier, especially during the pandemic. They would spare more time to absorb knowledge, as well as to entertain. Thus, people’s relationships and their entertainment experience would overall be improved. On the businesses side, streaming services like Netflix, Spotify, and restaurants, as well as publishers would be able to increase revenue. As the nature of Reco is to encourage people to watch a movie, read a book, get something to eat, listen to something, as fast as possible.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="tab7">
                <p>Giang, my friend in class, thinks that the idea is brilliant. She totally understands the painful process of browsing through Netflix, or choosing a restaurant to eat. She would definitely use it if there is something like Reco on the App store. However, she does not think that acquiring an enormous database of all movies, books, restaurants, and songs available would be feasible. I would argue that for movies, there is a free open-source database called “The movie DB”, and Goodreads is a well-known and available database for books. However, it is true that acquiring the data about restaurants and food stalls in Vietnam would be a big challenge. Similarly, Spotify would definitely keep the songs data for themselves. Although getting data through web scraping would be doable, it is not exactly legal. Nevertheless, I completely agree that retrieving the database would be the most challenging part in developing this application.

                <p>Ha, one of my friends, thinks that with the data and human resources the giant businesses already had, they could easily build something similar if they want to. Thus, Reco might quickly be buried by these giants. Personally, I think businesses can only build their own recommender systems, and continue to enhance the user experience. They cannot build an all-in-one system. Most importantly, they would not want to waste their resources on building something entirely new. If anything, they can buy the technology from us. </p>

                <p>Autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars, or driverless cars, or robo-cars, are vehicles that can sense their surroundings and move safely with little or no human intervention [6].</p>
                <p>Currently, automobile companies are putting their best efforts into developing their own line of self-driving cars [7]. The leader of the industry is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) [8]. As its name suggests, these cars do not need a driver, or anyone to control them. They can drive by themselves. However, there are several levels of “autonomous”, defined by the SAE International (also known as Society of Automotive Engineers). In general, from level 0 to level 2, the driving environment is monitored entirely by humans, and the system only assists the drivers with features such as danger warnings, or speed adjusting automation. Even in Level 2, where the system can control all parts of driving including steering, acceleration, and brake, the drivers’ monitor is mandatory, and must always intervene with driving tasks. The true state of the art of autonomous cars happens from level 3 to level 5, where human intervention to the driving environment is not necessary, or only required when needed [9]. Specifically:</p>
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2">
                  <i class="bi bi-check2">&nbsp;</i>
                  <p>In level 3, the driver can safely take both their hands and eyes off the driving tasks. The system can drive entirely by itself. However, in special circumstances in which the system cannot handle, it will require the driver to take control, and the driver must be available to do so [9].</p>
                </div>
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2">
                  <i class="bi bi-check2">&nbsp;</i>
                  <p>In level 4, it inherits all level 3 features, and it does not need anyone to be awake, or available to take control of the driving tasks upon requests. However, there will be pre-conditions, for example, it can only operate within a limited range, or cleared and safe roads [9].</p>
                </div>
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2">
                  <i class="bi bi-check2">&nbsp;</i>
                  <p>In level 5, the state of the art is at its peak, it inherits all the other levels’ features, and operates under all conditions. There is no limit to level 5 type vehicles [9].</p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="av2">
                <p>The idea of autonomous vehicles started way back in the 1920s, when inventors created a radio-controlled system. The car could be controlled by a human sitting in another car nearby it. The system utilized the technology of transmitting antenna and radio impulses [11].</p>
                <p>In 1939, radio impulses were replaced by electromagnetic fields, backed by circuits installed on the road, broadening the horizon of remote-controlled vehicles.</p>
                <p>Between the 1950s and 1960s, electromagnetic fields and circuits were substituted by underground magnetic cables [12][13].</p>
                <p>In 1989, Carnegie Mellon University applied the neural network into controlling autonomous vehicles [14], and launched the project “No Hands Across America” in 1995 [15].</p>
                <p>In 1996, the ARGO Project was launched, featuring a vehicle with stereoscopic vision algorithms for environment detection [16].</p>
                <p>In 2009, Google launched its self-driving car development program [17].</p>
                <p>In the 2010s, many automobile companies announced they were developing their own lines of autonomous vehicles. This was also the time when these companies started introducing cars with autonomous assisting features to the public, these cars are defined around Level 0 to Level 2 in the SAE International classification system [9].
                </p>
                <p>In 2015, Volvo announced a Level 3 car [18], marking a new era for self-driving cars. From the late 2010s to early 2020s, most major automobile manufacturers such as Mercedes, Audi, and BMW announced and launched their own lines of Level 3 autonomous cars.
                </p>
                <p>There was buzz around Level 4 and Level 5 vehicles, and yet, no official announcements had ever been made.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="av3">
                <p>As can be seen from the brief history of self-driving cars, current working versions are around Level 3, in which people’s hands and eyes could be taken off, and only need to drive when requested. As autonomous vehicles involve directly with the lives of human beings, there are many controversial discussions around moral and human issues. Specifically, the MIT laboratory has created a moral machine to assist not only autonomous vehicles research but also the moral of AI in general [19]. Along with it, many regulations are considered and billed in order to keep the manufacturers and their projects legal and safe for the public. I believe that the regulations and moral discussions have taken a part in slowing down the development of autonomous cars. Nevertheless, moral discussions are vital and should not be underestimated.
              </p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="av4">
                <p>In the near future, there might not be many advances towards the higher levels of autonomous driving, the companies would first streamline their lines of Level 3 cars. Then, in the next three to five years, thanks to the information gathered from those, they will learn and improve level 3 cars into level 4 cars, and then level 5 cars - the actual peak of the art. Part of me really hopes that the transformation progress could be slow and steady, so that the outcomes are flying colors. However, autonomous vehicles are the greatest issues among the whole industry at the moment, and manufacturers are trying their best to be the first. There will be no “slow and steady”, they will rush towards the goal. But a lot of testing, as well as regulations will be done by that time, they will have to always revise their product until it is perfected. In the long run, it is completely not feasible to say that scientists could conquer the moral complex.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="av5">
                <p>There are countless advantages from this development. Everybody on the planet would be affected by this invention, if it becomes a huge success. First of all, traffic jams would be significantly reduced if all cars are autonomous, they could speak to each other, and calculate the best routes together. Moreover, Public safety would be better than ever. It would not only decrease the rate of deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents, but also help the human beings in general by removing their worries about driving. In addition, as less traffic accidents happen, the cost of car maintenance and repair would be greatly decreased. It would also help the environment as the cars would be able to calculate the most efficient way to save energy thanks to their smart algorithms and machine learning models.</p>
                <p> 
                  Personally, I do not drive, or ride any kind of vehicle except for bicycles. I can do it, but I am always terrified by the roads. Especially in Vietnam, where traffic is horrendous. I always wish that the vehicles could drive by themselves, so the minds of the hurry people never have to bother with driving tasks. If autonomous cars Level 5 come true, and become affordable and accessible, I believe the world would be a dream world.

                <p>Quantum computing is the use of collective characteristics of quantum states to conduct computation, like superposition and entanglement. Quantum computers are the machines that conduct quantum computations. Certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which drives RSA encryption), are found to be remarkably faster to solve on quantum computers [20]. Quantum computing is a branch of quantum information science, which is the study of quantum information. As the discipline turns toward real-world applications in pharmaceutical, data security, and other areas, growth is predicted in the next several years [21].</p>

                <p>Physics professor Paul Benioff proposed in 1980 a quantum mechanical version of the Turing machine [22]. A quantum computer, according to Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin, could mimic things that a conventional computer couldn't [23]. The quantum factoring method invented by Peter Shor in 1994 has the potential to decode RSA encrypted communications. The majority of experts feel that "fault-tolerant quantum computing is still a very distant dream," despite continuing experimental advances since the late 1990s [24]. Recently, governmental and commercial sector investments in quantum computing research have risen [25]. ​​As of 23 October 2019, Google AI claimed to have completed a quantum calculation that was infeasible on any conventional computer, in cooperation with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [26].</p>

                <p>In addition to the quantum circuit model, the quantum Turing machine, the adiabatic quantum computer and the one-way quantum computer, there are a variety of quantum cellular automata. In computing, the quantum circuit is the most frequently used model, as it is based on the quantum bit (or "qubit"), which is similar to the bit in conventional processing. Quantum states of qubits can be either 1 or 0, or a superposition of the two. Nevertheless, when it's measured, it's either 0 or 1; the likelihood of either outcome relies on the qubit's quantum state just before the measurement takes place.
                </p>
                <p>Many of the technologies that are being developed in order to produce high-quality qubits for a physical quantum computer rely on transmon technology as well as ion traps and topological quantum computers. According to the quantum computer's computing paradigm, these qubits may be built in many ways, including quantum logic gates, quantum annealing, or adiabatic quantum computation The construction of usable quantum computers is currently hindered by a number of important hurdles. Because qubits suffer from quantum decoherence and state integrity, maintaining their quantum states is extremely challenging. There is a need to rectify errors in quantum computers as a result [27][28].</p>
                <p>Quantum computers can tackle every computational issue that can be addressed by a conventional computer. However, any issue that can be solved by a quantum computer can be solved by a conventional computer, at least in theory, if there is enough time. As a result, quantum computers adhere to the Church-Turing theorem. So, while quantum computers do not give any extra advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for specific problems have considerably lower temporal complexity than comparable classical algorithms that are well-known.</p>

          <h2>IT Work</h2>
          <p>Interview with Minh</p>
        </header>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>As I am more confident in mobile and web technologies, my current career vision lies in these two areas. Thus, I have decided to interview Minh, one of my best friends, who is currently a Junior Software Engineer at a Switzerland software company, based in Vietnam. Minh has recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from the Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, University of Science. Minh’s main role is working on mobile applications. It is safe to say that he is a mobile application developer. His tools include a cross-platform mobile application framework called Flutter, and back-end technology with Node.JS. However, currently, he is working on an internal tool in the form of a web application, using Flutter for Web. Most of the time at work, Minh spends on the computer with his codes and tasks.</p>
            <p>As a junior engineer, Minh does not have much chance to interact with clients or investors, or the general public. These are the kinds of people that his managers would definitely have to deal with a lot. There are two groups of people that Minh interacts with: the engineers and the non-technical people. Specifically, Minh thinks the engineers and managers with a technical background would be more understanding of the work. Nevertheless, it does not always go so smoothly with people from other departments such as designers, accountants, or business development people. Especially in communication, Minh and his colleagues always have to explain to them when something is not achievable, and it is not easy to convince them.</p>
            <p>As for his main working environment and interactions with his team and other IT professionals, Minh says that there are definitely debates, and discussions on which approach the team should use for the products. But these debates are based on rationale and logic, not on the experience hierarchy. He is thankful that his teammates are really nice, and understanding. They do not act arrogant, and they always listen to his opinions, regardless of his years in the field. There are also misunderstandings between IT professionals from different fields. The usual solution is to find a mediator who knows about both of the fields and could explain it to the others.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Minh believes that besides coding and completing his assigned tasks, communication usually takes up the most of his time. There are a lot of team meetings, as well as personal (one-on-one) meetings between him and the people from other departments such as designers, or the users of the internal tools.</p>
            <p>Minh thinks the essence of the industry is that it is constantly evolving. It is not something people can just learn from school and keep on using the same knowledge. It is definitely not a mundane, boring job that is repetitive. Especially, he always has to keep himself updated with the technology, trends and changes and tools for the job. He could get all the ready-to-build tools, and all the knowledge from school. Yet, it is very hard to apply in reality. Minh explained: “The tools are made for you. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But even so, it is hard to apply. It is like LEGO blocks, you don’t have to make plastics and turn them into LEGO blocks. But they gave you LEGO blocks and expect you to build up a house. Building up a house with LEGO blocks is still difficult stuff, regardless of how simple you thought it would be.” He thinks that this is one of the most challenging aspects of the industry. It is also the most beautiful, and the most pleasant part.</p>
            <p>I have also asked Minh one question which I think is important for junior programmers:<br>
            “As a junior programmer, when there are difficulties in the tasks that you are in charge of. How would you go about consulting with other seniors or your manager? How would you approach them so that they don’t think that you’re incapable, judge you, or assess your performance on it?”
            </p>
            <p>Minh understands and he says that it does happen a lot. He advised, the safe way to approach it is that he would try to guess the senior’s reaction, then ask around his peers, the people on the same level as he is.
